# Q-Learning-pygame
An application of reinforcement learning with PyGame

Objective of the game:
Avoid obstacles or get penalized
Collect coins to increase points

Objective of the project:
Demonstrate applicability of reinforcement learning on a simple board game
Q-learning (value iteration) of MDP(Markov decision process) has been applied to train agent to take correct action

Play by yourself:
1. Install python 2.7 or higher (32 bit)
https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
2. Install pygame module
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
3. Run module testing_main.py

Watch bot getting trained while it plays the game
3. Run module main.py

Future scope:
Add complexity in the game and reward system
Apply neural nets to reduce space requirements of virtually infinite state space
